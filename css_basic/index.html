	       <h1>1. The Building Blocks of the Web</h1>
	       <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies that power nearly every website on the internet. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) forms the structure of a webpage, allowing developers to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a site — it tells the browser what content should appear and in what order. Without HTML, there would be no foundation to display anything online.</p>
	       <h2>2. Bringing Style to the Structure</h2>
	       <p>While HTML structures the content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for its appearance. CSS controls colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and overall visual design. With just a few lines of CSS, a plain HTML page can be transformed into a beautifully styled interface. Developers use CSS to make websites responsive, ensuring they look great on everything from mobile phones to large desktop screens.</p>
	       <h3>3. Adding Interactivity with JavaScript</h3>
	       <p>JavaScript is what brings websites to life. It’s a programming language that runs in the browser and allows developers to create dynamic and interactive features like sliders, dropdown menus, popups, form validation, and real-time updates without reloading the page. JavaScript is also the backbone of powerful frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, which are used to build modern web applications.</p>
	       <h4>4. Working Together Seamlessly</h4>
	       <p>What makes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so powerful is how they work together. HTML provides the structure, CSS makes it attractive, and JavaScript adds behavior. Whether you’re building a simple portfolio site or a full-fledged web app, mastering these three technologies is the first step to becoming a front-end developer. With the ever-growing demand for responsive and interactive websites, understanding how these languages interact is more valuable than ever.</p>
